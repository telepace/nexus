- Prefer using the shadcn/ui component library for UI implementation
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- For Chrome extension development, follow Manifest V3 specification
- For unfamiliar APIs, query usage via api docs integrated in mcp
- Implement components elegantly and aesthetically; avoid redundancy and repetition
