description: Frontend Development Code Guidelines

- When writing frontend code, prioritize using Next.js as the framework
- Prefer the combination of shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for UI components
- Do not use Next.js API routes (/api); always use backend APIs for all API requests
- If the backend API is unclear or in question, use the MCP api docs tool to find the relevant API definition- 
- The UI library should be isolated from the code base and placed in components/ui
