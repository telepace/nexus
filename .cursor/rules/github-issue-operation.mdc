**Github Repository Resolution Logic:**

- If owner and repo are explicitly provided, use them.
- Otherwise, default to:
    
    owner: telepace
    
    repo: nexus

    milestone: v0.1
    
    (i.e., https://github.com/telepace/nexus)

- The language chosen for raising an issue: Chinese
- Your task might be for other ais to read or solve, so try to understand the project information as much as possible and provide sufficient and important context
- Before writing the issue content, use mcp's thinking in combination with the current repository code and implementation to think about what the solution to the task is.
- Be careful not to be too AI in your tone.
- Pay attention to choosing the appropriate labels and types.
- Assign tasks. If it is a simple UI-related task, assign it to @Neo-Neooo, and if it is a complex task, deployment, cicd, assign it to @cubxxw. If both the front-end and back-end are involved, it only needs to be assigned to @cubxxw
- If possible, describe the design drawings or architecture drawings using mermaid code blocks as much as possible
- No need for my confirmation. Just execute directly

**Postgres db operation Logic:**

- db name is `app`
