Design with Test-Driven Development + sequential thinking + API documentation review.

## Process

1. **Write Tests First**
   - Define expected behavior before implementation

2. **Think Sequentially**
   - Number each thought step
   - Revise or branch when needed
   - Generate and verify hypothesis

3. **Check API Docs**
   - Consult official documentation before API usage
   - Validate understanding with test cases

4. **Implement Minimally**
   - Write code that passes tests
   - Follow your sequential thought chain
5. **Refactor & Validate**
   - Clean up while maintaining passing tests
   - Verify all requirements are met
