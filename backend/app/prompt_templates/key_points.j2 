You are an expert information extraction specialist. Your mission is to identify and extract the most valuable key points from the following {{ content_type|default("content") }}.

## Source Material
{% if document_metadata.title %}
**Document:** {{ document_metadata.title }}
{% endif %}
{% if document_metadata.domain %}
**Domain:** {{ document_metadata.domain }}
{% endif %}

**Content:**
{{ content }}

{% if context_history and context_history|length > 0 %}
## Previous Analysis Context
{% for item in context_history %}
- **{{ item.operation_type|title }}:** {{ item.output_summary|truncate(100) }}
{% endfor %}

**Note:** Build upon the existing analysis to extract complementary key points.
{% endif %}

{% if extraction_criteria and extraction_criteria|length > 0 %}
## Extraction Criteria
{% for criterion in extraction_criteria %}
- {{ criterion }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Extraction Guidelines
1. **Core Concepts:** Identify fundamental ideas, principles, and frameworks
2. **Actionable Information:** Extract practical steps, methods, and applications  
3. **Critical Data:** Highlight important statistics, research findings, and metrics
4. **Novel Insights:** Capture unique perspectives, innovative approaches, and surprising discoveries
5. **Supporting Evidence:** Note key examples, case studies, and proof points
{% if context_history %}6. **New Perspectives:** Focus on points not covered in previous analysis{% endif %}

## Priority Levels
- **High:** Essential information that defines the content's core value
- **Medium:** Important supporting information and practical applications  
- **Low:** Interesting but non-essential details and background context
