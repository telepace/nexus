## Feature Relationships and Code Structure

This diagram shows how the key features relate to specific code components:

Application Structure

FastAPI Backend                   React Frontend               PostgreSQL Database             Traefik Proxy

main.py: App Initialization       main.tsx: App Entry          
api/: Route Definitions           routes/: Page Components     
models/: Data Models              components/: UI Components   
core/: Core Configuration         hooks/: Custom Hooks         
utils/: Utilities                 providers/: Context Providers
dependencies/: DI Components      client/: Generated API Client

routes/users.py: User Endpoints   login.tsx: Login Page        User: User Model
routes/items.py: Item Endpoints   items.tsx: Items Management  Item: Item Model
routes/login.py: Auth Endpoints   users.tsx: User Management   Token: Auth Token Models
routes/utils.py: Utility Endpoints dashboard.tsx: Main Dashboard

                                  query.ts: Data Fetching Hooks
```

## Authentication Flow

The template implements a robust authentication system with JWT tokens. Here's the authentication flow between frontend and backend components:

```
Database(SQLModel) → Security(core/security.py) → Login API(routes/login.py) → API Client(client/) → Auth Hook(hooks/auth.ts) → Login Page(routes/login.tsx) → Browser

1. User enters credentials
2. Login page calls auth hook
3. Auth hook calls API client
4. API client sends POST to /login/access-token
5. Login API processes request
6. Security module authenticates user
7. Database verifies credentials
8. Token created and returned if valid
9. Token stored in local storage
10. Auth state updated
11. User redirected to dashboard
```

## Database Models

The template uses SQLModel for defining data models with relationships:

```
User
- UUID id
- EmailStr email
- str hashed_password
- str full_name
- bool is_active
- bool is_superuser
- relationship items

Item
- UUID id
- str title
- str description
- UUID owner_id
- relationship owner

Relationship: User(1) owns Item(*)
```
