# Sentry Integration

## Introduction

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform that helps you identify and fix issues in your application. This guide will walk you through setting up Sentry in your Quick Forge AI project.

The backend of this project already comes with Sentry integration, which means you only need to configure it with your DSN to start tracking errors.

## Prerequisites

- A Sentry account (you can [sign up for free](https://sentry.io/signup/))
- A deployed Quick Forge AI application or a local development environment

## Setting Up Sentry

### 1. Create a Sentry Project

1. Sign in to your [Sentry account](https://sentry.io/auth/login/)
2. Create a new project by clicking on "Create Project"
3. Select "Python" as the platform
4. Name your project (e.g., "quick-forge-backend")
5. Follow the setup to create your project

### 2. Get Your DSN

After creating a project, Sentry will provide you with a Data Source Name (DSN). This is a unique identifier that Sentry uses to associate events with your project.

1. Navigate to Settings → Projects → [Your Project] → Client Keys (DSN)
2. Copy the DSN value, which should look like: `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@xxxxxxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxxxx`

### 3. Configure Your Application

#### Environment Variables

Add your Sentry DSN to your environment variables:

1. In your local development environment, add the DSN to your `.env` file:

```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn-here@xxxxxxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxxxx
```

2. For production deployments, make sure the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is set in your deployment configuration.

#### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file already includes the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable, which will be picked up from your `.env` file:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      - SENTRY_DSN=${SENTRY_DSN}
```

#### Kubernetes/Helm Deployment

For Helm deployments, update the `values.yaml` or `values.prod.yaml` file:

```yaml
backend:
  env:
    SENTRY_DSN: "your-sentry-dsn"
```

## How Sentry Is Initialized

The application will automatically initialize Sentry if the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable is set and the environment is not "local". This is handled in `backend/app/main.py`:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.core.config import settings

if settings.SENTRY_DSN and settings.ENVIRONMENT != "local":
    sentry_sdk.init(dsn=str(settings.SENTRY_DSN), enable_tracing=True)
```

This means:
- Sentry is only enabled when you provide a DSN
- Sentry is disabled in local development by default (to avoid sending development errors)
- You can enable it in local development by setting your environment to something other than "local"

## Testing Your Sentry Integration

To verify that your Sentry integration is working correctly:

1. Deploy your application with the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable set
2. Generate an error in your application (for testing purposes only)
3. Check your Sentry dashboard to see if the error was captured

Here's a simple way to generate a test error in a FastAPI endpoint:

```python
@app.get("/test-sentry")
def test_sentry():
    try:
        1 / 0  # This will cause a division by zero error
    except Exception as e:
        # This will send the error to Sentry
        raise e
    return {"message": "This endpoint should raise an error"}
```

## Best Practices

### Environment Separation

Make sure to create separate Sentry projects for different environments (development, staging, production) to keep your error tracking organized.

### Contextual Information

You can enhance your error reports by adding context to your Sentry events:

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Add user context
sentry_sdk.set_user({"id": "12345", "email": "user@example.com"})

# Add custom tags
sentry_sdk.set_tag("transaction_id", "123456789")

# Add extra data
sentry_sdk.set_extra("order_details", {"amount": 100, "currency": "USD"})
```

### Performance Monitoring

Sentry also offers performance monitoring capabilities. You can configure this by setting `enable_tracing=True` in the initialization (already done in the template) and adding performance monitoring code to specific parts of your application.

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Being Captured

If your events are not showing up in Sentry:

1. Verify that your DSN is correct
2. Check that your application environment is not set to "local"
3. Ensure that your application has internet access to send events to Sentry
4. Look for any errors in your application logs related to Sentry initialization

### Rate Limiting

If you're on a free Sentry plan, be aware that there are limits to the number of events you can send. Configure your integration to prioritize the most important errors.

## Conclusion

Sentry is a powerful tool for tracking and monitoring errors in your application. With the configuration outlined in this guide, you should be able to start capturing errors and improving the reliability of your Quick Forge AI application.
