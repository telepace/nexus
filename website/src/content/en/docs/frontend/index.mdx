# Frontend Development

The Quick Forge AI frontend is built with TypeScript and React, providing a modern, type-safe user interface. This section covers the frontend architecture, key components, and how to extend the frontend for your needs.

## Architecture Overview

The frontend follows a component-based architecture using React:

1. **Components** - Reusable UI building blocks
2. **Pages** - Route-specific views constructed from components
3. **Hooks** - Custom logic for state management and side effects
4. **Services** - API clients and external integrations
5. **Utilities** - Helper functions and shared code

## Key Technologies

- **TypeScript**: Type safety for JavaScript
- **React**: UI component library
- **Chakra UI**: Component library for responsive design
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Jest/Testing Library**: Testing frameworks

## Getting Started with Frontend Development

To start developing the frontend:

1. **Understand the existing code**:
   - Explore the component structure in `src/components/`
   - Review the page components in `src/pages/`
   - Look at the API integration in `src/services/`

2. **Set up your development environment**:
   - Follow the [setup instructions](/en/docs/getting-started)
   - Run the frontend development server: `cd frontend && pnpm dev`

3. **Access the application**:
   - Once running, access the app at `http://localhost:3000`
   - The backend should also be running for API calls to work

## Main Components

### UI Components

The UI is built with reusable components organized in `src/components/`. These include:

- **Common Components**: Buttons, cards, modals, etc.
- **Layout Components**: Page layouts, navigation, sidebar
- **Form Components**: Input fields, forms, validation
- **Feature Components**: Components tied to specific features

### Routing

Routing is handled with React Router in `src/App.tsx`, defining:

- Public routes (accessible to anyone)
- Protected routes (requiring authentication)
- Layout routes (for consistent page structure)

### State Management

State is managed using a combination of:

- React's built-in `useState` and `useReducer` for local state
- Context API for shared state across components
- React Query for server state (API data)

### API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through:

- Auto-generated TypeScript API client based on OpenAPI schema
- Custom service modules in `src/services/`
- Authentication handling with JWT tokens

### Theming

The application supports dark/light mode using Chakra UI's theming system, with:

- Consistent color schemes
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessible components following WCAG guidelines
