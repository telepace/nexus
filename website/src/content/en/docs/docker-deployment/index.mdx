# Docker and Deployment

This guide will help you understand how to containerize your Quick Forge AI application and deploy it to various environments.

## Docker Setup

Quick Forge AI comes with pre-configured Docker support to make containerization easy and consistent across environments.

### Docker Compose Configuration

The project includes several Docker Compose files for different purposes:

- `docker-compose.yml` - Base configuration for development
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Local development overrides
- `docker-compose.traefik.yml` - Configuration with Traefik for routing
- `docker-compose.docs.yml` - Documentation website deployment

### Basic Docker Commands

Start all services in development mode:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Build and start in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

View logs for all services:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Stop all services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Production Deployment

### Environment Preparation

Before deploying to production, ensure you have set all required environment variables in your `.env` file or your deployment platform's environment configuration.

Key variables to configure:

```
SECRET_KEY=secure-production-key
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
POSTGRES_SERVER=your-db-server
POSTGRES_USER=production-user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure-db-password
POSTGRES_DB=quick_forge_prod
```

### Deployment Options

Quick Forge AI can be deployed to various platforms:

#### Kubernetes with Helm

The project includes Helm charts in the `helm-charts` directory for Kubernetes deployment:

```bash
# From the project root
cd helm-charts
helm install quick-forge-ai ./quick-forge-ai --values ./your-values.yaml
```

#### Fly.io Deployment

Deploy to Fly.io using the provided configuration:

```bash
# Install the flyctl CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Login to Fly.io
fly auth login

# Deploy the application
fly launch
```

#### Docker Swarm

For Docker Swarm deployment:

```bash
# Initialize swarm if not already done
docker swarm init

# Deploy the stack
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml -c docker-compose.prod.yml quick-forge-ai
```

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory for CI/CD integration:

- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Build and deployment to your hosting environment

## Scaling Considerations

### Database Scaling

For production environments, consider:
- Using a managed PostgreSQL service
- Implementing connection pooling with PgBouncer
- Setting up read replicas for high-traffic applications

### Application Scaling

The application is designed to scale horizontally. Configure your deployment to:
- Use multiple backend instances behind a load balancer
- Implement a CDN for frontend static assets
- Use Redis for caching and session management in distributed environments

## Monitoring and Logging

For production deployments, implement:
- Application monitoring with Prometheus or similar tools
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack or managed services
- Error tracking with Sentry (already integrated in the backend)

## Next Steps

After deploying your application:
1. Set up [SSL certificates](/en/docs/deployment/ssl)
2. Configure [backup strategies](/en/docs/deployment/backups)
3. Implement a [CI/CD pipeline](/en/docs/deployment/ci-cd) tailored to your specific needs
