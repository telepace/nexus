# Database Configuration Options

Quick Forge AI supports two database deployment options, giving you flexibility in your development and production environments:

1. **Direct PostgreSQL Deployment (Default)**: A PostgreSQL database deployed alongside your application using Docker
2. **Supabase Cloud Service**: Connect to a managed PostgreSQL database in Supabase cloud

This guide will walk you through both options, including detailed steps for configuration and switching between them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Quick Forge AI installed and set up
- Docker and Docker Compose (required for PostgreSQL direct deployment)
- A Supabase account (required for Supabase option) - [Sign up here](https://supabase.com)

## Automatic Database Detection

Quick Forge AI now automatically detects which database to use based on your environment variables:

- If `SUPABASE_URL` is set in your environment variables, the system will use Supabase
- If `SUPABASE_URL` is not set, the system will use direct PostgreSQL deployment

This makes it easy to switch between database options by simply updating your environment variables, without needing to run additional configuration commands.

## Option 1: Direct PostgreSQL Deployment

### Manual Setup

To configure PostgreSQL direct deployment, update your `.env` file with these settings:

```
# PostgreSQL Direct Deployment Configuration
POSTGRES_SERVER=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
POSTGRES_DB=app
```

Then start your services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Option 2: Supabase Cloud Service

### Creating a Supabase Project

1. Sign in to your [Supabase account](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Click "New Project" and select your organization
3. Enter a project name and secure database password
4. Choose a region close to your target users
5. Wait for your project to be created (usually takes 2-3 minutes)

### Getting Your Supabase Connection String

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Database"
2. Scroll down to "Connection String" and select "URI"
3. Copy the connection string, which will look like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.abcdefghijkl.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```

### Manual Setup

To configure Supabase, update your `.env` file with these settings:

```
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.abcdefghijkl.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

Then start your services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Switching Between Options

You can switch between PostgreSQL direct deployment and Supabase at any time by updating your `.env` file:

1. To use Supabase, add the `SUPABASE_URL` environment variable:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.abcdefghijkl.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```

2. To use PostgreSQL direct deployment, remove or comment out the `SUPABASE_URL` variable and ensure your PostgreSQL settings are configured:
   ```
   # Remove or comment out SUPABASE_URL
   # SUPABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.abcdefghijkl.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   
   # Ensure PostgreSQL settings are set
   POSTGRES_SERVER=db
   POSTGRES_PORT=5432
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   POSTGRES_DB=app
   ```

3. Stop and restart your services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

**Important**: When switching database options, your data will not be automatically migrated. You will need to handle data migration manually if needed.

## Migrating Data Between Databases

### Exporting from PostgreSQL

```bash
# For direct PostgreSQL deployment
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres -d app > database_backup.sql

# For Supabase (install psql client locally)
pg_dump "postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.abcdefghijkl.supabase.co:5432/postgres" > database_backup.sql
```

### Importing to a New Database

```bash
# For direct PostgreSQL deployment
cat database_backup.sql | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d app

# For Supabase (install psql client locally)
psql "postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.abcdefghijkl.supabase.co:5432/postgres" < database_backup.sql
```

## Database Migrations with Alembic

Quick Forge AI uses Alembic for database migrations, which works with both PostgreSQL direct deployment and Supabase.

### Creating a Migration

After modifying your models, create a migration:

```bash
# Enter the backend container
docker-compose exec backend bash

# Generate a migration script
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of your changes"

# Apply the migration
alembic upgrade head
```

The system will automatically run these migrations against your configured database, whether it's direct PostgreSQL or Supabase.

## How It Works

Quick Forge AI implements this feature through:

1. Automatic database detection in `backend/app/core/config.py`
2. Docker Compose service profiles in `docker-compose.yml`

### Technical Details

- The system checks if `SUPABASE_URL` is defined in your environment
- If present, it connects directly to Supabase using that URL
- If not present, it uses the PostgreSQL connection parameters
- When using Supabase, you can disable the local PostgreSQL service in Docker Compose

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues with Supabase

- Check if your Supabase project is active
- Verify that your connection string is correct
- Ensure your IP address is allowed in Supabase networking settings

### PostgreSQL Direct Deployment Issues

- Check if the PostgreSQL container is running with `docker-compose ps`
- View PostgreSQL logs with `docker-compose logs db`
- Ensure your `.env` has the correct database credentials

## Best Practices

- **Development**: Use direct PostgreSQL deployment for ease of development
- **Testing**: Consider Supabase for shared testing environments
- **Production**: Choose based on your scaling needs and management preferences
- **CI/CD**: For CI, the direct PostgreSQL option can be more reliable

By supporting both options, Quick Forge AI gives you the flexibility to choose the right database approach for your specific needs and project phase.
