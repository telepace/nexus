# Getting Started with Quick Forge AI

This guide will help you set up and start working with Quick Forge AI. Follow these steps to create your development environment and understand the basic project structure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Docker and Docker Compose** (optional but recommended)
- **Git**

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Quick Forge AI repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telepace/quick-forge-ai.git
cd quick-forge-ai
```

### Step 2: Setup the Environment

You can set up your development environment using the automated script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Or, you can set up manually:

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
pnpm install
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `.env.example`. Important values to update:

```
# Generate secure secret keys with:
# python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Required security settings
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key
FIRST_SUPERUSER=admin@example.com
FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-db-password

# Optional email settings
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL=info@example.com
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Servers

Start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database
- Backend FastAPI service
- Frontend development server
- Traefik for routing (if configured)

## Verifying the Setup

Once the services are running, you can verify the setup by accessing:

- Backend API at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- API documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- Frontend application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Adminer at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Next Steps

Now that you have Quick Forge AI up and running, you can:

1. Explore the [Project Structure](/en/docs/getting-started/project-structure) to understand how the codebase is organized
2. Learn how to use the [Authentication System](/en/docs/backend/authentication)
3. Start building your own [API Endpoints](/en/docs/backend/api-endpoints)
4. Create new [Frontend Components](/en/docs/frontend/components)
5. Implement [AI Features](/en/docs/ai-integration/overview) into your application
