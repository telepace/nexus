# Project Structure

Quick Forge AI follows a well-organized structure to separate concerns and make development easier. This page explains the key directories and their purpose.

## Overview

The project is organized into several main directories:

```
quick-forge-ai/
├── .github/                # GitHub workflows and templates
├── backend/                # FastAPI application
├── frontend/               # TypeScript React application
├── e2e/                    # End-to-end tests with Playwright
├── docker/                 # Docker configuration
├── docs/                   # Documentation
├── scripts/                # Utility scripts
├── docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose configuration
└── docker-compose.prod.yml # Production Docker Compose
```

Let's explore each of the main directories in more detail.

## Backend

The backend is a FastAPI application organized as follows:

```
backend/
├── app/                # API code
│   ├── api/            # API endpoints
│   ├── core/           # Configuration
│   ├── db/             # Database models and config
│   ├── services/       # Business logic
│   └── utils/          # Utility functions
├── tests/              # Backend tests
├── alembic/            # Database migrations
├── poetry.lock         # Locked dependencies
└── pyproject.toml      # Python project config
```

Key components:
- `api/`: Contains all API endpoints, grouped by functionality
- `core/`: Core configuration, including security and settings
- `db/`: Database models, session management, and SQLModel definitions
- `services/`: Business logic separated from endpoints
- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `alembic/`: Database migration scripts

## Frontend

The frontend is a React application with TypeScript, organized as follows:

```
frontend/
├── src/                # Application code
│   ├── components/     # React components
│   ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
│   ├── pages/          # Page components
│   ├── services/       # API service integrations
│   ├── types/          # TypeScript types
│   └── utils/          # Utility functions
├── tests/              # Frontend tests
├── package.json        # npm package config
└── vite.config.ts      # Vite configuration
```

Key components:
- `components/`: Reusable React components
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for shared logic
- `pages/`: Page-level components
- `services/`: API client and service integrations
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `utils/`: Helper functions
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Docker Setup

The Docker configuration is designed to provide a consistent development and production environment:

```
docker/
├── backend/            # Backend Dockerfile
└── frontend/           # Frontend Dockerfile
```

The root directory contains various Docker Compose files:
- `docker-compose.yml`: For local development
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`: For production deployment
- `docker-compose.docs.yml`: For documentation site

## GitHub Workflows

The `.github/workflows/` directory contains CI/CD pipelines:
- Test workflows for backend and frontend
- Build and deployment workflows
- Documentation site deployment

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts for:
- Setting up the development environment
- Database management
- Deployment helpers
- Various automation tasks
