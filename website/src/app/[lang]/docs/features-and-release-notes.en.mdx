## Feature Relationships and Code Structure

This diagram shows the relationship between key features and specific code components:

```
Application Structure

FastAPI Backend                React Frontend              PostgreSQL Database      Traefik Proxy

main.py: App initialization    main.tsx: App entry          
api/: Route definitions        routes/: Page components     
models/: Data models           components/: UI components   
core/: Core configuration      hooks/: Custom hooks         
utils/: Utilities              providers/: Context providers
dependencies/: DI components   client/: Generated API client

routes/users.py: User endpoints    login.tsx: Login page        User: User model
routes/items.py: Item endpoints    items.tsx: Item management   Item: Item model
routes/login.py: Auth endpoints    users.tsx: User management   Token: Auth token model

                                  query.ts: Data fetching hooks
```

## Authentication Flow

The template implements a robust authentication system using JWT tokens. Here is the authentication flow between frontend and backend components:

```
Database(SQLModel) → Security(core/security.py) → Login API(routes/login.py) → API Client(client/) → Auth Hooks(hooks/auth.ts) → Login Page(routes/login.tsx) → Browser

1. User enters credentials
2. Login page calls auth hook
3. Auth hook calls API client
4. API client sends POST to /login/access-token
5. Login API processes request
6. Security module authenticates user
7. Database validates credentials
8. If valid, token is created and returned
9. Token is stored in local storage
10. Auth state is updated
11. User redirected to dashboard
```

## Database Models

The template uses SQLModel to define data models with relationships:

```
User
- UUID id
- EmailStr email
- str hashed_password
- str full_name
- bool is_active
- bool is_superuser
- relationship items

Item
- UUID id
- str title
- str description
- UUID owner_id
- relationship owner

Relationship: User(1) owns Item(*)
```
